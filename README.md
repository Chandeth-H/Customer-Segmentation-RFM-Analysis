# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis

## Understanding RFM Analysis

RFM Analysis is essential for effective customer segmentation, focusing on three critical dimensions: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

1. Recency: This metric assesses the time since a customer's last purchase. Understanding recency helps us gauge customer engagement levels. A recent purchase signifies an active customer who is likely more receptive to further communications and promotional offers.

2. Frequency: This measures how often a customer makes purchases over a specified period. Frequency indicates the consistency of a customer's transactions. High-frequency customers demonstrate strong loyalty and satisfaction, whereas infrequent purchasers may need targeted re-engagement strategies to rekindle their interest.

3. Monetary: This evaluates the total amount a customer has spent on purchases. Analyzing monetary value allows us to identify high-value customers who significantly contribute to revenue. Conversely, customers with lower spending may require tailored initiatives to encourage increased purchasing activity.

## Project Overview

This project conducts an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail company. The dataset includes all transactions occurring between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011, primarily focusing on unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers in this dataset are wholesalers.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle.
