# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis

## Understanding RFM Analysis

RFM Analysis is essential for effective customer segmentation, focusing on three critical dimensions: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

1. Recency: This metric assesses the time since a customer's last purchase. If a customer bought something recently, it shows they are active and more likely to respond to our messages and offers.

2. Frequency: This measures how often a customer makes purchases over a specified period. Customers who buy regularly are usually more loyal and satisfied. On the other hand, those who donâ€™t buy often might need some encouragement to shop again.

3. Monetary: This evaluates the total amount a customer has spent on purchases. By looking at this, we can find our most valuable customers who help bring in revenue. Customers who spend less might need special offers to get them to buy more.

## Project Overview

This project conducts an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail company. The dataset includes all transactions occurring between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011, primarily focusing on unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers in this dataset are wholesalers.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle.

## Analysis & Insight

### Sales Trend

This line graph shows a fluctuating trend in total sales over the months from December 2010 to December 2011. Sales start at around 500,000 in December 2010, indicating a moderate beginning. There are several ups and downs throughout the months, with notable peaks and troughs. For instance, sales dip around mid-2011, suggesting a possible seasonal variation or other market influences. A significant spike occurs in November 2011, where total sales peak at just under 1,000,000. This could point to a successful marketing campaign, product launch, or seasonal demand. In December 2011, due to lack of data, we can't determine the trend of this whole month.
