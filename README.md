# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis

RFM Analysis is essential for effective customer segmentation, focusing on three critical dimensions: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

1. Recency
- Definition: This metric assesses the time since a customer's last purchase.
- Purpose: Understanding recency helps us gauge customer engagement levels. A recent purchase signifies an active customer who is likely more receptive to further communications and promotional offers.

2. Frequency
- Definition: This measures how often a customer makes purchases over a specified period.
- Purpose: Frequency indicates the consistency of a customer's transactions. High-frequency customers demonstrate strong loyalty and satisfaction, whereas infrequent purchasers may need targeted re-engagement strategies to rekindle their interest.

3. Monetary 
- Definition: This evaluates the total amount a customer has spent on purchases.
- Purpose: Analyzing monetary value allows us to identify high-value customers who significantly contribute to revenue. Conversely, customers with lower spending may require tailored initiatives to encourage increased purchasing activity.
