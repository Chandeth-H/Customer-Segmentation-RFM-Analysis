# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis

## Understanding RFM Analysis

RFM Analysis is essential for effective customer segmentation, focusing on three critical dimensions: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

1. Recency: This metric assesses the time since a customer's last purchase. If a customer bought something recently, it shows they are active and more likely to respond to our messages and offers.

2. Frequency: This measures how often a customer makes purchases over a specified period. Customers who buy regularly are usually more loyal and satisfied. On the other hand, those who donâ€™t buy often might need some encouragement to shop again.

3. Monetary: This evaluates the total amount a customer has spent on purchases. By looking at this, we can find our most valuable customers who help bring in revenue. Customers who spend less might need special offers to get them to buy more.

## Project Overview

This project conducts an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail company. The dataset includes all transactions occurring between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011, primarily focusing on unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers in this dataset are wholesalers.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle.

### RFM Insight

1. Recency:
- Champions: This segment shows the lowest recency (5.4 days), indicating they have interacted very recently and are highly engaged customers.
- Hibernating and At Risk: These segments have significantly higher recency values (215.9 and 153.5 days, respectively), suggesting that these customers haven't engaged with the brand for a long time and may need reactivation efforts.

2. Frequency:
- Champions exhibit the highest frequency (12.2 purchases on average), showing they are frequent buyers, which is ideal for business.
- Can't Lose customers also show high frequency (8.5 purchases), indicating they are valuable to the business and should be nurtured.
- The New Customers segment has the lowest frequency (1 purchase), highlighting the potential for increased engagement and retention strategies.

3. Monetary:
- Champions lead in monetary value, with an average spend of $6,139.73, indicating they contribute significantly to revenue.
- Can't Lose customers also have high monetary value ($2,841.44), suggesting they are high-value customers worth focusing on.
- In contrast, Promising customers have the lowest average spend ($264.76), indicating they may need more incentives to increase their purchase value.

### Segment Analysis

- Champions: These are the most valuable customers, frequently purchasing and spending significantly. Strategies should focus on loyalty programs and personalized offers to retain them.
- At Risk: This group should be targeted with re-engagement campaigns to bring them back, as they have not interacted for a considerable time but still have potential.
- Hibernating: With high recency, these customers need targeted communication to revive their interest.
- Loyal Customers: Although they engage regularly, their spending is moderate. Upselling and cross-selling strategies could enhance their monetary contributions.
- New Customers: They need nurturing to increase their frequency and spending, potentially through welcome campaigns and special offers.

## Conclusion

The RFM analysis identifies key customer segments, allowing for tailored marketing strategies that enhance customer engagement, retention, and revenue growth. By focusing efforts on high-value segments like Champions and Can't Lose, while developing strategies for lower-value segments, the business can optimize its customer relationships and overall performance.
